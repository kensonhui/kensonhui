### Hi there!  ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth-year student @ UWaterloo and WLU for Computer Science & Business Administration.

What's been brewing at the moment:
- I'm currently working on supercharging research paper reading, check it out here: https://ourslash.company/
- On the side, I've been working on the marketing for a dessert spot opening in Waterloo, yum!
- Iâ€™m learning PyTorch, I've implemented a CNN, GANS for digits, the original Transformer model in "Attention is All You Need" and a Diffusion Model.
