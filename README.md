### Hi there!  👋

I recently graduated from UWaterloo and WLU for Computer Science & Business Administration.

What's been brewing at the moment:
- Cofounding [Pierview](https://www.pierview.ai) and working with 20+ clients on improving their rankings on ChatGPT and Perplexity. 
- I'm currently working with friends on supercharging research paper reading, check it out here: [Treeline](https://treeline.vercel.app/)
- On the side, I've been working on the marketing for a dessert spot opening in Waterloo, yum!
- I’m learning PyTorch, I've implemented a CNN, GANS for digits, the original Transformer model in "Attention is All You Need" and a Diffusion Model.
